Object Oriented Programming:
	
	The key feature of OOPS concepts is Data Security

Other features:
	
	- Binding data into template
	- Reusability of code
	- Reducing space complexity
	- Encapsulate the protected data
	- Reducing the time and efforts of programmer
	- Increase the readability of the program
	
Components of OOPs:

	1. Class
	2. Object
	3. Encapsulation
	4. Inheritance
	5. Polymorphism
	6. Abstraction
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
Class:
	
	- A user defined data type or blueprint
	- A class is a collection of data members and member functions.
	- Where data members are the variables declared inside a class
	- and Member Functions are the methods defined inside a class.
	
Object:

	- A representator or a part of a class.
	- Helps in accessing the members of a class.
	- When object oa a class is created, memory get allocated to all the data members of the class, but the memory for the methods are allocated only when they are called.
	
Constructor:
	- A special methods that helps in initializing the data members of the class. If we don't have a constructor in a class than all the data members gets initialized by their data values with respect to their types by a constructor of an object.
	- But if you have any constructor in your own class, object class constructor doesn't invoke.
	- The name of the constructor is same as the name of the class.
	- They don't have a return type.
	- We don't use these methods for input, ouptut or operations
	- Constructors are invoked implicitely.
	
Types of Constructor:
	
	1. Default Constructor
	2. Parameterized Constructor
	3. Copy Constructor
	4. Private Constructor
	5. Static Constructor or Static block
	
- In Java, a constructor is not allowed to be abstract, final, static and native. So there is no static constructor in Java.

- We can use static blic in Java to initialize the static members of the class.

- As static keyword is associated with class, static blockis executed before constructor of the class

- Whene we create an object of a class, before allocating to the memory to the instance data members, first memory is allocated to the static class member

Constructor Chaining:
	
	- A constructor from another constructor. 
	- Also called as Constructor Overloading.

-------------------------

Inheritance:
	- Helps in reusability of code
	- Helps in reducing time and efforts of the programmer
	- Helps in inheriting the attributes and behaviours of parent class into child class.
	- A class can extends only one class at a time.
	- When we create an object of the child class we can access the public members and methods of both child and parent class.
	- Parent Class: Base Class/ Super Class
	- Child Class: Derived Class/ Sub class
	
--------------------------

Types of Inheritance:
	
	- Single Inheritance
	- MultilevelInheritance
	- Heirarichial inheritance

- These below mentioned types of inheritance can be achieved using interfaces
	
	- Multiple Inheritance
	- Hybrid Inheritance
