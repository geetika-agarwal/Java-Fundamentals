File Handling:
	
	File Handling helps in storing the data into the file system.
	
	Java offers a list of classes and methods to work with File System
	
	All these classes are available within java.io package.
	
	Working with file handling is to work with Streams.
	
	Stream is a group of data or characters that travels from source to detination and vice versa.
	
	Streams are of two types in Java:
	
		- Byte Stream (InputStream Class, OutputStream Class)
		- Character Stream (Reader Classes, Writer Classes)
