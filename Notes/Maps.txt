HashMap:
	
	- It is a hash table based on the Map interface.
	
	- Map helps us to store data in key-value pairs.
	
	- HashMap cannot contain duplicate keys. 
	
	- HashMap also allows null key or null value considering no null key duplicates.
	
	- HashMap is an unordered collection.
	
	- HashMap is not thread-safe. Explicitly synchronize.
	
Methods in HashMap:

put(key, value): This will add the data to the map and no duplicates are allowed. If the key is duplicated, the value is overridden by the value.

putIfAbsent(key, value): This will only add unique key values, and duplicated key values are ignored.

isEmpty(): This will check if the map is empty.

size(): This will return the size of the map.

containsKey(key): This will return a boolean value if the particular key is present in the list or not.

get(key): This will return the value that is present in the key. If there is no key present then it will return null.


containsValue(value): This will return a boolean value if the value is present in the map or not.

remove(key, value): This will return a boolean value based on whether the key value was removed successfully or not.

entrySet(): This will store the hashmap in entries to set collection.

keySet(): This stores all the keys of the HashMap into a Set.

values(): This will return the Collection of all the values present in the map.
