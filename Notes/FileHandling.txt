File Handling:
	
	File Handling helps in storing the data into the file system.
	
	Java offers a list of classes and methods to work with File System
	
	All these classes are available within java.io package.
	
	Working with file handling is to work with Streams.
	
	Stream is a group of data or characters that travels from source to detination and vice versa.
	
	Streams are of two types in Java:
	
		- Byte Stream (InputStream Class, OutputStream Class):
			Syntax:
				For Writing into File:
					FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(Absolute Path of the File);
					OutputStreamWriter out = new OutputStreamWriter(outStream);
					
					// Throws IOException.
					
				For Reading from File:
					FileInputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(Absolute Path of File);
					InputStreamReader reader = new InputStreamReader(inStream);
					
					// Throws IOException
					
		- Character Stream (Reader Classes, Writer Classes)
			Syntax:
				Writing into the File:
					Writer writer = new FileWriter(Absolute Path of the File);
					
					// Throws IOException
				
				Reading from the file:
					Reader reader = new FileReader(Absolute Path of the File);
