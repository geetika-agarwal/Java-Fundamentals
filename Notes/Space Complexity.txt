Space Complexity:
	
	- It is the amount used by the algorithm that is used during the execution and generate the result.
	- Auxillary space is the extra ot the temporary space used by the algorithm during it's execution.
		Space Complexity = Auxillary Space + Input Space
	
	- While executing  the algorithm, it uses the memory space for three reasons:
		- Instruction Space 
		- Environmental Space
		- Data Space
