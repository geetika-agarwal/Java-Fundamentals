There are some errors being raised by compiler or interpretator at compile time and run time depending upon the coding approach a developer follows.

There are types of errors:
	
	- Compile-Time Errors: caught by compiler while writing a program. They occur when we do a syntactical mistakes, or mis-spell any keywords. They are also considered as:
		- Syntactical Errors
			- Missing SemiColons
			- Mis-spelled Keywords
		- Semantic Errors (Expressional Errors)
			- When we write incorrect expressions.
			eg.: num1 + num2 = num3; (incorrect)
			
			num1 =+ num1; (incorrect)
			num1 += num2 (correct)
		

Note: Programmers need to handle or resolve the compile-time errors by themselves.

	- Run-Time Errors:
		These errors occur due to incorrect input or invalid inputs.
		They are occured at excution time.
		They can be resolved with the help of Exception Handling.
		The program gets abnormally terminated due to exceptions.
	
	- Logical Errors:
		These errors occurs when we don't get an expected output.
		These are the errors raised by developers.
		They are due to incorrect logic or incorrect use of operations.

Exception Handling:
	
	There are two types of Exceptions:
		- Checked Exceptions: These occur during the Compile-time.
		
		- Unchecked Exception: These occur during the run-time of the program excution.
