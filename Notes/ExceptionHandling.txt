Some errors are being raised by the compiler or interpreter at compile time and run time depending on the developer's coding approach.

There are types of errors:
	
	- Compile-Time Errors: caught by the compiler while writing a program. They occur when we do syntactical mistakes or misspell any keywords. They are also considered as:
		- Syntactical Errors
			- Missing SemiColons
			- Mis-spelled Keywords
		- Semantic Errors (Expressional Errors)
			- When we write incorrect expressions.
			eg.: num1 + num2 = num3; (incorrect)
			
			num1 =+ num1; (incorrect)
			num1 += num2 (correct)
		

Note: Programmers need to handle or resolve the compile-time errors by themselves.

	- Run-Time Errors:
		These errors occur due to incorrect input or invalid inputs.
		They occurred at execution time.
		They can be resolved with the help of Exception Handling.
		The program gets abnormally terminated due to exceptions.
	
	- Logical Errors:
		These errors occur when we don't get the expected output.
		These are the errors raised by developers.
		They are due to incorrect logic or incorrect use of operations.

Exception Handling:
	
	There are two types of Exceptions:
		- Checked Exceptions: These occur during the Compile-time.
		
		- Unchecked Exception: These occur during the run-time of the program execution.
